      <h2>Book Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        repoze.bfg is a small, fast, down-to-earth, open source Python
        web development framework. It makes real-world web application
        development and deployment more fun, more predictable, and
        more productive.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book will show you how to develop web applications using
        repoze.bfg and Python step-by-step, including:
      </p>

      <p>

        <ul>
          <li>Using SQLAlchemy and ZODB along with repoze.bfg.</li>
          <li>Using built-in templating facilities to render HTML and XML.</li>
          <li>Using repoze.bfg security functionality to protect your application.</li>
          <li>Exending an existing repoze.bfg application without changing its source code.</li>
          <li>Using sessions within repoze.bfg.</li>
          <li>Running repoze.bfg under mod_wsgi.</li>
          <li>Deploying your repoze.bfg application to Google's App Engine.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        
      <p>
        This book is written by the primary author of repoze.bfg. It
        has developed along with framework itself, and therefore
        contains the most accurate and up to date information.
